# cnn-hyperparameter-optimization-pathmnist
This project explores the classification of medical images using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the PathMNIST dataset, part of the MedMNIST collection. The core focus is on hyperparameter testing to identify the optimal CNN architecture for multi-class classification.
